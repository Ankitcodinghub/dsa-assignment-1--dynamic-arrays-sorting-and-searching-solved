1 Introduction

In this assignment, you are to implement dynamic arrays to store a sequence of records. You are also required to sort the array using merge sort, quick sort, and selection sort and compare the time taken by these approaches. You also need to implement linear and binary search algorithms and compare the performance of these approaches. Since the binary search algorithm only works for the key used for sorting, you need to sort the array using different keys to facilitate fast searching for different kinds of queries.

You need to implement the dynamic arrays with geometric expansion approach, as discussed in class. Initially, the array size is zero. During the first insertion, you need to create an array of size one. For subsequent insertions, if the array is full, you need to create a new array of double size, copy the contents of the old array to the new array, delete the old array, and insert the element in the new array.

During the deletion, if you want to delete an element at a given position i, if i is the last element, decrease the array size by one; otherwise, copy the last element to position i before decreasing the array size by one. After the deletion, if only N/4 space is occupied the array, where N is the size of the array, create a new array of size N/2, copy the elements from the old array to the new array, and delete the old array. We call it a shrink operation.

In this assignment, you are to store a sequence of struct record values in the dynamic array. A struct record definition is as follows.

#define MAX_LEN 16

struct record {

/* character string terminated with ‚Äô‚Äô

* maximum length is 16

*/ char name[MAX_LEN];

/* a character array of 16 characters

* not-necessarily terminated with ‚Äô‚Äô

* anywhere in the character array

*/ char uid[MAX_LEN]; int age;

/* location */ struct location loc;

/* list of posts */ struct list_tri *posts;

/* list of friends */ struct list_rec *friends;

/* needed for shortest Path */ int status; struct record *pred;

/* needed for the tree data-structure */ int height; struct record *left; struct record *right; struct record *parent;

};

For this assignment, only name, uid, and status fields are relevant. You can ignore the values of other fields. You are not allowed to make any changes in struct record.

You need to store the starting address of the dynamic array in the variable record arr provided in the skeleton code. This variable is initialized to NULL. You can think of NULL as an invalid address. After every expansion or shrink operation, you need to store the starting address of the new array in the record arr variable.

3 Sorting and searching uids [1 mark]

You need to implement merge sort, quick sort, and selection sort algorithms to sort the array using uid field in the struct record as a key. uid contains a unique 16-byte identifier corresponding to a record. This is not a string, i.e., ‚Äò‚Äô can also be part of the uid and appear multiple times in the array. You can directly use cmp uid routine from the skeleton code that compares two uids and return -1, 0, and 1 if the first uid is less than, equal, and greater than the second uid, respectively. You need to implement two search algorithms, linear search and binary search, to search a record corresponding to a particular uid and compare the performances of these algorithms.

4 Sorting and searching names [1 mark]

In this part, you need to find the number of records corresponding to a given name. Notice that the name field in struct record is a ‚Äò‚Äô terminated character string. One way of implementing this is linear search, but it is inefficient. The other strategy would be to sort the array using name as a key and then use binary search to find a record with the given name and traverse the nearby elements to find the total number of records corresponding to a name. You need to implement both strategies and compare the performance of both algorithms. You need to use the quick sort algorithm for this part.

5 Library interface

In this assignment, you need to implement a library that implements all the functionalities we discussed above. The user interface for your library is given in the ‚Äúpa1.h‚Äù file. Below is the short description of these interfaces.

search record linear: Use the linear search algorithm to find the record corresponding to the input uid. If there is no matching record, return a dummy record with ‚àí1 in the status field.

search record binary: Use the binary search algorithm to find the record corresponding to the input uid. If there is no matching record, return a dummy record with ‚àí1 in the status field.

sort records quick: Use the quick sort algorithm to sort the record arr using uid as the key.

sort records merge: Use the merge sort algorithm to sort the record arr using uid as the key.

sort records selection: Use the selection sort algorithm to sort the record arr using uid as the key.

get num records with name linear: Find the number of records corresponding to the input name using the linear search algorithm.

get num records with name binary: Find the number of records corresponding to the input name using the binary search algorithm.

rearrange data: Use the quick sort algorithm to sort the record arr using name as the key.

get num records: Return the total number of records present in the record arr.

get record arr: Returns the starting address of the dynamic array. The implementation is already provided. Don‚Äôt change this implementation.

6 Compilation and running the test cases

Clone the assignment repository using: git clone https://github.com/Systems-IIITD/DSALAB.git

Implement everything in the ‚ÄúPA1/pa1.c‚Äù file. Don‚Äôt change any other files. Use printf to debug your code. Run ‚Äúmake‚Äù in the ‚ÄúPA1‚Äù folder to compile your library and test cases. There are three test cases. To run the first test cases: use ‚Äú./test1 10‚Äù. It will test your program for ten records. Once your implementation works for small sizes, test and debug it for large sizes. To run the second test for size 10, use ‚Äú./test2 10‚Äù. To run the third test case for size 10, use ‚Äú./test3 10‚Äù. We will test your implementation for large input sizes. So make sure to test them for large inputs as well. You are not allowed to use malloc and free directly in your library. Use allocate memory and free memory routines provided to you instead of malloc and free.

7 Bonus part

In this part, you need to implement a worst-case O(n) algorithm to find the median and use that as the pivot in your implementation of quick sort. You can find an O(n) algorithm in Chapter-9.3 of the CLRS book. If you do the bonus assignment, dump the implementation of your median finding algorithm after the outputs of make submit. Also, justify why your implementation is O(n). Referring to the book will not be considered a valid justification. Don‚Äôt submit any additional files apart from the ‚Äúpa1.c‚Äù and your report.
